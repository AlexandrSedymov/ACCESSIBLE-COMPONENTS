# Accessibility Components - Deep Codebase Research (GPT-5 Assisted)

> This document captures structured research following a 3‑step analysis brief. The original brief referenced a `src/app/` directory; this project uses a flat `src/` layout (no `app/` folder), so scope has been adapted accordingly.

---

## Step 1. Documentation & Business Intent Review

### Sources Consulted
- `README.md`
- `ACCESSIBILITY.md`
- `docs/FOCUS_MANAGEMENT.md`
- `docs/VOICEOVER_FOCUS_SOLUTIONS.md`
- Selected source files in `src/` (components, hooks, utils)

### Stated / Implied Business Goals
| Goal | Description | Evidence |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Accessibility-first library | Provide reference implementations of WCAG 2.1 AA compliant components | README features, ACCESSIBILITY.md |
| Educational resource | Teach developers correct patterns (focus, semantics, forms, dialogs) | Extensive docs + contrasting modal patterns |
| Multi-layer a11y testing | Catch violations early (dev console, unit, CLI scan) | axe-core + jest-axe + CI axe scan |
| Demonstrate modal strategies | Show trade-offs: manual, native `<dialog>`, Radix primitive | 3 modal implementations |
| Showcase navigation focus management | Improve SR & keyboard UX on SPA route changes | `useFocusManagement`, focus docs |
| Encourage semantic correctness | Distinguish links vs buttons usage patterns | `LinksVsButtons` page |
| Promote maintainable DX | Modern stack (Vite, TS, ESLint, Prettier, RHF) | Tooling in package.json |

### High-Level Architectural Themes
- **Client-side SPA** using React Router; no backend/API layer present.
- **Three modal paradigms** illustrate progressive enhancement and abstraction levels.
- **Central a11y utilities** (axe config + dialog polyfill + focus hook) abstract recurring concerns.
- **Pedagogical pages** (e.g. LinksVsButtons, InputField) act as interactive guides, not just demos.
- **Strict page skeleton contract**: `main#main-content` + top-level `h1#main-title` for focus targeting & skip link.
- **Testing layered strategy**: unit (Vitest + Testing Library + jest-axe), E2E (Playwright), post-build static axe scan.
- **Performance awareness**: Vite manual chunking, SWC, minimal rerenders via React Hook Form.

### Conventions (Inferred / Explicit)
| Area | Convention | Rationale |
|------|------------|-----------|
| File naming | Components `PascalCase.tsx`, hooks `camelCase` prefixed with `use` | React idioms & clarity |
| Accessibility | Always prefer semantic element; add ARIA only when required | Reduce verbosity / redundancy |
| Focus management | Programmatic focus after navigation; prefer focusing `h1` | VoiceOver clarity |
| Validation timing | Forms validate `onBlur` | Minimizes SR noise while typing |
| External links | `target="_blank"` + `rel="noopener noreferrer"` + SR hint | Security + UX transparency |
| Modal closing | ESC, backdrop click, explicit close buttons | WCAG 2.1.2 & user control |
| Commit messages | Conventional style (`feat:`, `fix:`…) | Readable history / tooling compat |
| Styling | Utility CSS + component CSS modules + accessible focus outlines | Consistent & visible focus |

### Domain Vocabulary
- **Accessible Component**: A UI unit meeting semantic, keyboard, and SR criteria.
- **Focus Trap**: Prevents keyboard focus from escaping an active modal/dialog.
- **Skip Link**: First tabbable link allowing bypass of repetitive navigation.
- **Programmatic Focus**: Manual DOM focus to announce context changes in SPA routing.

## Step 2. Source Scan (Adapted from `src/app/` to `src/`)

### Categories Reviewed
- Components (`src/components/*`): Modals (3 patterns), Navbar, navigation/link education, code example viewer, link section.
- Hooks (`src/hooks/useFocusManagement.ts`): Route-change focus & visual outline logic.
- Pages (`src/pages/*`): Scenario demos (forms, dialogs, semantics).
- Utilities (`src/utils/*`): axe test helpers, dialog polyfill, (potential future shared helpers).
- Styling (`src/styles/*`): Focus states, layout, a11y-oriented CSS.
- Testing Setup (`test-setup.ts`, Playwright config): Environment preparation & polyfills.

### Key Implementation Highlights (Preview)
- **Focus Hook**: Debounced (delay) DOM query, heading-first strategy, reversible outline styling.
- **Manual Modal**: Custom focus trap & ESC/backdrop handlers + restoration to trigger.
- **Native Dialog**: Reliance on platform semantics; minimal custom logic.
- **Radix Dialog**: Delegates a11y heavy lifting to library; lean integration.
- **Forms**: React Hook Form (onBlur) + async simulation + ARIA linking for errors (in extended code not all shown here).
- **Accessibility Test Utility**: Configured axe instance + granular violation reporting & keyboard navigability audit.
- **Vite Config**: Manual chunk splitting for vendor, router, syntax highlighting languages.

## Step 3. Critical Logic, Edge Cases, Business Rules (Will follow in subsequent sections)

### 3.1 Critical Logic

| Area | File / Construct | Purpose | Failure Impact | Notes |
|------|------------------|---------|----------------|-------|
| Route Focus Management | `src/hooks/useFocusManagement.ts` | Announces content change & positions keyboard focus after navigation | SR users may not know page changed; keyboard users must tab through nav again | Prioritizes `<h1>` for VoiceOver clarity; fallback to main region |
| Manual Modal Focus Trap | `src/components/InformationModal.tsx` | Keeps tab focus inside modal; supports ESC/backdrop closure & restoration | Tab order escapes; ESC unusable; focus lost | Uses live NodeList snapshot at open; manual trap logic |
| Native Dialog Lifecycle | `src/components/NativeAlertDialog.tsx` + polyfill | Delegates a11y semantics & focus to browser for alert/confirm patterns | Degraded semantics in unsupported envs (tests) | Polyfill augments missing methods in JSDOM |
| Radix Dialog Integration | `src/components/LibraryModal.tsx` | High-level accessible modal with reduced custom code | If misused (omitting primitives) could break a11y | Relies on library correctness; minimal local logic |
| Form Validation Workflow | `src/pages/InputField.tsx` (React Hook Form) | Provides accessible error states, async submission simulation | Users receive poor feedback or can submit invalid data | `onBlur` mode intentionally chosen over `onChange` |
| Axe Testing Utilities | `src/utils/test-accessibility.ts` | Central, configurable axe runner & keyboard nav tests | Silent a11y regressions | Throws on violations in helper wrapper |
| Dialog Polyfill | `src/utils/dialog-polyfill.ts` | Enables consistent dialog behavior in tests (JSDOM lacks APIs) | Unit tests fail / miss semantics | Adds ARIA attributes + ESC handling |
| Navigation Semantics | `src/components/Navbar.tsx` | Current page indication with `aria-current="page"` & visual class | Users lose orientation in SPA | Pairs with skip link + focus hook |
| Skip Link Mechanism | `src/App.tsx` + `.skip-link` styles | Allows bypassing repeated nav content | WCAG 2.4.1 violation; extra tab burden | Points to `#main-title` heading |

#### Focus Management Flow (Simplified)
```
Route change -> delay (100ms) -> query target (#main-content)
	 -> if h1 child exists: ensure tabindex -1, focus h1
	 -> else: ensure tabindex -1 on main, focus main
	 -> apply temporary outline -> remove on interaction or timeout
```

#### Manual Modal Trap Flow
```
Open -> collect focusables -> keydown(Tab):
	if Shift+Tab on first -> focus last (preventDefault)
	else if Tab on last -> focus first (preventDefault)
ESC -> closes -> restore focus to trigger (async defer)
Backdrop click / Enter on backdrop -> close
```

### 3.2 Edge Cases

| Edge Case | Context | Handling Strategy | Residual Risk |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| Missing `<h1>` in page | Focus hook expects heading for SR clarity | Fallback to main element; adds tabindex | Less descriptive SR announcement |
| Rapid navigation before focus timeout | Users click links fast | Timeout cleared in cleanup | Momentary skipped focus outline possible |
| Modal opened with zero focusables | Malformed modal content | Guard: length check before trap logic | User stuck unless ESC/backdrop works |
| Focus trap + dynamic element removal | Elements removed mid-session | Trap relies on initial snapshot only | Could allow escape / unexpected focus order |
| VoiceOver only reads “heading level 1” | macOS SR quirk | Focus heading directly; tabindex -1 | Some timing variance remains |
| ESC key conflict (multiple listeners) | Multiple modals or nested dialogs | Each modal registers / deregisters on mount/unmount | Nested custom + library modals require coordination (not implemented) |
| Backdrop click vs content click | Closing only when outside content | Compares event target to ref | Shadow DOM / portals would need adaptation |
| Form resubmission spam | User double clicks submit | `isSubmitting` gates UI + disable patterns (partial) | No explicit disable on code path unless implemented |
| Async submission delay | Simulated network latency | `setTimeout` + state flags | Race conditions if component unmounts (no abort) |
| Native `<dialog>` unsupported in test env | JSDOM lacks methods | Polyfill augments prototype | Divergence from real browser edge timing |
| External links opening silently | New tab UX confusion | SR-only text “(opens in a new tab)” | Localization not yet handled |
| Keyboard outline removal too soon | 3s timeout or user interaction | Interaction cancels sooner | Low – purely cosmetic |
| Axe scan false positives during dynamic updates | Transition states | Runs after container render; resultTypes=violations only | Potential misses of incomplete states |

### 3.3 Business / Domain Rules

| Rule | Description | Standard / Rationale | Enforcement Mechanism |
|------|-------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| Page Skeleton | Each route has `<main id="main-content" role="main">` + single top `<h1 id="main-title">` | Landmark nav & SR orientation | Manual convention + focus hook fallback |
| Skip Link Presence | First tabbable element must be skip link | WCAG 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks | Present in `App.tsx`; review required for new layouts |
| Heading Focus Priority | Focus `<h1>` on navigation | VoiceOver announcement fidelity | `useFocusManagement` logic |
| External Link Disclosure | Indicate new tab & secure rel attrs | Predictable UX + security | Manual pattern in pages |
| Form Validation Timing | Use `onBlur` unless justified | Reduce SR noise | RHF config in form pages |
| Modal Closure Methods | Must support ESC, visible close button, backdrop click | User control & escape | Implemented per modal variant |
| Focus Trap Integrity | No keyboard escape from active modal | WCAG 2.1.2 | Manual trap / native / Radix |
| Color Contrast | Maintain ≥ WCAG AA contrast ratios | WCAG 1.4.3 | axe rule enabled + manual design |
| Keyboard Only Usability | All interactions reachable via keyboard | WCAG 2.1.1 | Testing utilities + manual QA |
| Aria-Current Usage | Use `aria-current="page"` for active nav item | Orientation & location | Navbar implementation |
| Temporary Outline Cleanup | Don’t leave artificial outlines | Visual clarity | Time + interaction listeners |
| Dialog Role Appropriateness | Use `role="alertdialog"` for destructive confirmations | Proper urgency semantics | NativeAlertDialog, Radix alert variant potential |

### 3.4 Derived Quality Attributes
| Attribute | Support Mechanisms |
|-----------|--------------------|
| Accessibility | Focus hook, axe tests, semantic HTML, ARIA patterns |
| Maintainability | Modular components, single-responsibility hooks, utilities |
| Performance | SWC, manual chunking, RHF controlled rerenders |
| Testability | Polyfills, deterministic utilities, Playwright separation |
| Learnability | Code comments, contrasting implementation patterns |

### 3.5 Risk Register (Current)
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Divergence between simulated and real dialog behavior | Medium | Medium | Add browser-based integration tests |
| Missing consistent error patterns across forms | Medium | Low | Centralize error UI component |
| Focus race conditions on extremely slow devices | Low | Medium | Consider MutationObserver fallback |
| Over-reliance on manual conventions (page skeleton) | Medium | Medium | Add ESLint custom rule / runtime assertion |
| Unlocalized SR-only strings | High | Low | Introduce i18n layer with default English catalog |

### 3.6 Suggested Improvements
| Improvement | Benefit | Effort |
|------------|---------|--------|
| Add ESLint rule to enforce page skeleton pattern | Prevent structural regressions | Medium |
| Introduce accessibility test snapshots (axe diff) | Detect new violations trend | Medium |
| Provide shared `<AccessibleModal>` abstraction | Reduce duplication, unify API | Medium |
| Add automation for external link auditing | Ensure disclosure consistency | Low |
| Implement focus ring via `:focus-visible` only | Better UX for mouse users | Low |
| Centralize form error component | Consistent ARIA + visuals | Low |
| Add internationalization (i18n) scaffold | Globalization readiness | Medium |
| Visual regression tests (Playwright + diff) | Catch unintentional style changes | Medium |
| Add 404 / fallback route | Improve navigation resilience | Low |
| Provide CI badge for a11y scan status | Visibility of compliance | Low |

## Summary Snapshot
The project balances instructional clarity with production-grade accessibility techniques. Critical logic centers on **focus orchestration**, **modal interaction contracts**, **structured form validation**, and **multi-layer automated accessibility testing**. Edge cases are mitigated primarily through defensive DOM querying, fallbacks, and layered patterns (manual vs native vs library-powered dialogs). Institutionalizing a few conventions via lint rules and component abstractions would further harden quality as the codebase grows.
